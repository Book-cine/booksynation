Overall Description:
The BookSyNation app is a vaccination booking system intended for the facilitation of vaccination scheduling. It shall be developed using Flutter along with Firebase as its authentication and database (temporary back-end solution). This app is expected to operate on multiple platforms such as Android, and the Web. 

Vaccination scheduling is one of the current problems in this pandemic. A standardized system is currently non-existent which is why the process varies greatly among different vaccination sites. For instance, one site may schedule vaccinees randomly while other sites might operate on a first-come-first-serve basis. Thus, to introduce some standardization to the current system, the team intends to develop a National Vaccination Booking System, dubbed as the “BookSyNation”. 

BookSyNation was conceived as a way to improve the efficiency of the current vaccination scheduling process. The application handles the collection of basic information from the user, the booking of vaccination schedules by the user, the management of the booked schedules by the admin, and the handling of missed schedules booked using the app. 

Given approximately two (2) months of the development period, the focus of the team is on implementing the main functionalities detailed in the succeeding pages. Thus, deployment concerns such as verifying the identity and the authenticity of the collected information are currently outside the initial scope of the app.
